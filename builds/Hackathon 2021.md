# Hackathon 2021

This was created as part of Microsoft's [2021 Hackathon](https://garagehackbox.azurewebsites.net/hackathons/2356/projects/105003).

## Parts List

Parts are chosen to be plug and play, with no soldering required. This build uses the [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) I<sup>2</sup>C wiring system to be very easy to piece together.

Sensors can be left off if uninterested in their measurements.

### Addressable RGB

To wire the LEDs, some breadboarding or soldering will be required.

Other than the LEDs themselves, these parts do not require software support. Feel free to mix and match.
